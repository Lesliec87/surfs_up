# surfs_up

## Overview of the analysis: 

In this analysis we have came up with a plan of setting up a Surf n Shake in Oahu,Hawaii. Knowing we would need an investor backing us up, we put up a business plan and then reached out to investor W. Avy. 

W. Avy asks us to run some analytics on weather data set and request more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

### Summary Statistics for June:

### Summary Statistics for December:
